# Data Structures & Algorithms

## 1. What is this repository?
Basically this repository is a reference for the concept and implementation of some important data structures and algorithms. The idea is to record how a specifc topic works in general, then how to implement it in the programming languages I use the most (Python, C, C++ and maybe JavaScript) and also some classic exercises. This also a good practice to organize the way I study those topics (for all of them I will have to understand, implement and exercise).
